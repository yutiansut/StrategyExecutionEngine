TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price)
The TWAP strategy divides a large order into equal parts to execute over a
defined period. TWAP is calculated by taking the average price of the security
over a specific time period. This strategy is designed to execute a large order
evenly throughout the trading day, thereby reducing the risk of market impact
and price fluctuations.

Example: If a trader needs to buy 10,000 shares over 5 hours, the TWAP
algorithm will execute 2,000 shares each hour, ensuring an even distribution
and minimizing the impact on the market price.

Reference for Further Reading:
"The Market Maker's Edge" by Joshua Lukeman: This book explains the
importance of timing in trade execution and how traders can optimize their
strategies using TWAP. (Chapter 6 covers time-weighted strategies in detail).
